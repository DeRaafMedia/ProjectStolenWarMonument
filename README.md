ProjectStolenWarMonument is my solution for replacing a stolen war monument in the village I grew up in.

(Original statue)

The initial monument was a bronze statue made by the dutch artist Janny Brugman-de Vries [wiki -->](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janny_Brugman-de_Vries) with the title "Dringend Vermaan" (which means something like "Urgent Exhort") [Special wiki initiative to inventory all war monuments in the Netherlands -->](http://www.4en5mei.nl/herinneren/oorlogsmonumenten/monumenten_zoeken/oorlogsmonument/1133).

The monument was stolen in February 2014 [Translated news article -->](https://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=nl&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=nl&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bndestem.nl%2Falgemeen%2Fbinnenland%2Fburgemeester-ontzet-over-diefstal-beeld-oorlogsmonument-1.4213577&edit-text=)

Making a replica of the original art work is not really seen as a viable option, so the decision was made to replace the monument with a new one. I know this statue from my youth. It was one of my first contact with art that left an permanent impression.

My letter to the village counsel (Translated to English):

"Dear Sir / mevoruw,

I may not be a trained artist (but I engaged myself with media art (mostly) for many years now). After I read your call to send in idea's for replacing the monument "Dringend Vermaan", this idea popped up instantly in my head.

Personally, I would just let the pedestal stand, only with the contours of the statue re-shaped in a sustainable and "worthless" material (or possibly again bronze, concrete, recycled plastic?)

In my idea this would not only commemorate the sad events of the war, it would also make a visable statement about the way we percieve these kind of memorials and other manifestations of "our culture". 

It is also a clear indictment and symbol that people might be able to take away a tangible reminder of war, but one can never take away the ghost of that memory. It must always be remembered. 

Maybe it's a appeal that we need to have a look in the mirror? Populist statements that art and culture often simply means a "burden" to society ("leftist hobby" and that sort of thing) might be partly responsible for the disrespect that people display in their attitude against art (well, it's only art isn't it)?

Or is the story even sadder? Are there really people who do this kind of thing just to have a few more pennies in their wallet. 

Was this done by people that had no other options left? Are we living in a time that art needs to be liquidated into cash (legally or illegally) because people really hit the bottom? How many art objects where lost that way during the war the stolen monument commemorated?

I know (knew) the artwork. My family comes from Vriezenveen and surroundings. I myself grew up there."
